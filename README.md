Mood Palette is an interactive tool that translates the colors in an image to a palette. Through four core dimensions: Temperature, Energy, Contrast, and Vibe, users can extract a palette that mirrors the emotional state of an image.This prototype runs entirely in your browser. No images or data are stored or shared. Itâ€™s a client-side experiment designed for creative exploration and not a production environment.
